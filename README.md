# Speednote

Optimized Progressive Web Application (PWA) to input your thoughts as soon as possible.

## Background

I am a person who enjoys taking notes of the amount of money I spent on something every single day. In Japan, it is easy to keep track of everything because of its relative clearness with regards to prices and its no tipping culture. I usually type my expense right after spending my money to make sure that I do not forget (on the spot). Problem starts to happen when I use my usual note-taking app. After a long time of using it, I realized that it is unreasonably slow and I have to navigate through different menus before being able to type my expenses. My usual note-taking app is good for my usual note-taking activities, but not for this very specific activity. It is not just about expenses, sometimes I wrote something so I did not forget it later, and I usually don't want to create another note just for that specific purpose.

Honestly, the slowness and the overload of features is starting to get the better of me, so I decided to make another application to fulfill my personal use-case.

## Architecture and Concept

The concept of this application is just a single note with a title that you could use according to your use-case. You will type whatever you need / have been thinking about in that single note, and you **should move it to other note applications when you have the chance to do so**. This application should only be used for writing a general idea of something on the spot so that you do not forget it. At the moment, there are two terminologies when using Speednote: `title` is the title of the note, and `content` is the content of the note.

The data store that is used by the application is using the [fastest possible data store that could persist values](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56848541/13980107) across browser refreshes. The saving is done by implementing autosaves with debounce to make sure that it does not overload the browser. However, despite its speed, it should be kept in mind that this application **is not supposed to and should not be used for long-term note saving**. It is also recommended to not exceed the browser's `localStorage` size (making notes that are too long). You could test the maximum size of your browser's `localStorage` from [this website](https://arty.name/localstorage.html).

## Features

- Blazingly fast. When you open the app, you can instantly type after the editor is mounted.
- Utilization of Server Components and Client Components for maximum performance.
- Configurable theme, it will respect the system's theme initially, but you can always change it.
- Frozen notes. If you are afraid of accidentally deleting your note, just click on `Freeze note` to freeze your notes from changes. You cannot clear your notes if it's frozen, the button will be disabled.
- Shareable notes. You can share your note to other people by clicking `Copy/share note link` button. It will automatically copy your note-specific link to your clipboard. The format of the shared note is `https://<SPEEDNOTE_URL>/?title=<BASE64_ENCODED_TEXT>&content=<BASE64_ENCODED_TEXT>`. You can just share the `title` or the `content`, and anything else will be ignored if there are unknown query parameters.
- Complete with autosave function with reasonable debounce, so you don't have to worry about performance hits, lag, and data loss (stored in `localStorage`).
- The storage that is used, `localStorage`, is [known to be one of the fastest storage system](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46779140/13980107) and [can save in less than a millisecond](https://gomakethings.com/how-fast-is-vanilla-js-localstorage/).
- Versioned with the build date on the footer to know if the user is in the latest version of the application or not.
- Lightweight. I intentionally did not use any heavy UI-frameworks and decided to just use a normal CSS, augmented with SCSS to make it featherweight.
- Utilizes performance optimizations: re-rendering optimization (only on relevant components), and initializer pattern for static objects and functions for pure components.
- Responsive to make sure that this application could be used in various environments without losing UX.
- Works offline without any internet connection because this is a Progressive Web Application.
- Tested with React Testing Library to make sure everything works properly according to the expectations.
- Tested with Playwright (full end-to-end tests) as a way to assure that this application works in the browser properly and according to the expectations.

## Comparison

**To be kept in mind, the comparison is definitely not apple-to-apple as Speednote is only designed to fulfill a specific use-case, not a general use-case**. Table below will compare Speednote with several other note-taking applications:

## Tech Stack

- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the CSS preprocessor
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as the CI/CD part of the application
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as the deployment platform

## Requirements

You only need these software packages to run this application:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)

## Development

To start development quickly, please follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lauslim12/speednote.git
cd speednote
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

To create a production build, you need to follow the steps below:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

There are no dependencies (environment variables or the like), this is a standalone project.

## Tests

Because this project is still small, we can achieve a relatively high enough code coverage. There are two test libraries used in this project: React Testing Library and Playwright. For some reason, if you run the Playwright tests locally without building (using the production version), the `404 Not Found` tests will fail. It is possible that this is caused by the development build.

```bash
# To run RTL tests, do the commands below:
pnpm test
pnpm test-ci

# To run Playwright tests, do the commands below:
pnpm e2e
pnpm e2e-ci
pnpm e2e-prod
```
